# PyBomb
A python program with multiple payloads.
Use this at your own risk. I do not take responsibilty for any damage that happens to your computer while running this.


In order to use this you must have the following modules installed:

Pynput
pyautogui
Winshell

I might have missed some or your python installation might not have included some. Make sure to install the missing ones

The payloads are:

Keylogger plus picture of screen.
Takes a picture of the screen and sets it as the desktop background.
Changes mouse movement speed.
Pressing the control button will shut the computer down.
On the first run it makes a shortcut to the startup folder so then the script runs on startup.
Displays 10 windows that cant be exited out.

To run this program, download pyinstaller through pip. Pyinstaller currently will not work on python 3.7
