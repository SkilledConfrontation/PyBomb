# PyBomb
A python program with multiple payloads.
Use this at your own risk. I do not take responsibilty for any damage that happens to your computer while running this.


In order to use this you must have the following modules installed:

Pynput
pyautogui
Winshell

I might have missed some or your python installation might not have included some. Make sure to install the missing ones

The payloads are:

Keylogger emails keystrokes and a picture of the screen.
Takes a picture of the screen and sets it as the desktop background.
Changes mouse movement speed.
Pressing the control button will shut the computer down.
On the first run it makes a shortcut to the startup folder so then the script runs on startup.
Displays 10 windows that cant be exited out.

How to run this program:

To run this program, download pyinstaller through pip. Pyinstaller currently will not work on python 3.7.
To overcome this problem, I installed python 3.6.6 and pyinstaller worked then. To generate the .exe go to the project folder where the python script is at and do pyinstaller --noconsole Main.py. Once finished go back to the directory you ran it from. Run the .exe file and you should be good to go. Have fun installing this on a firends pc for a good prank!
